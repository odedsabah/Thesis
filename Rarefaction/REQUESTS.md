# Rarefaction Analysis Software Requirements

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended for parallel processing of FASTQ files
- **RAM**: Minimum 16GB, 32GB+ recommended for large FASTQ files
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for input FASTQ files (can be >1TB) and output files

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+)
- **Python**: Python 3.9 or higher
- **MetaPhlAn**: Version 4.0.6 or compatible version
- **External Tools**: Access to MetaPhlAn's run-metaphlan.sh script

## Python Package Dependencies
```
pandas>=1.0.0
scikit-bio>=0.5.6
numpy>=1.18.0
gzip
concurrent.futures
logging
math
argparse
```

## Input Requirements

### FASTQ Files
- High-quality sequencing data with preferably >100M reads per sample
- Paired-end or single-end files in compressed (.gz) format
- Pre-processed (quality trimmed, adapter removed) FASTQ files recommended

### Read Statistics File
- Tab-delimited file containing read counts for each sample
- Must include columns for sample ID and read count
- Example format:
  ```
  #Sample  File     File_type  Num_reads  Total_bases
  SAMN00040286  SRS019068.denovo_duplicates_marked.trimmed.1.fastq.gz  FASTQ  149762007  14965582301
  ```

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Time
- Processing time scales with the number of reads in the FASTQ file
- Full analysis of a 100M read file can take 12-24 hours depending on system
- Parallel processing is utilized to improve performance

### Memory Usage
- Memory usage increases with the number of species detected
- Typical usage ranges from 4GB to 16GB during analysis
- Peak memory usage occurs during the Metaphlan analysis phase

## Expected Outputs

### File Formats
- All output files are in CSV format for easy import into statistical tools
- Files contain headers with descriptive column names
- Floating-point values are rounded to 3 decimal places

### Storage Requirements
- Each analysis produces approximately 10-50MB of output files
- Long-term storage should be planned for retaining analysis results

## Future Requirements

### Planned Enhancements
1. Support for additional diversity metrics (UniFrac, Aitchison distance)
2. Integration with visualization tools for automated report generation
3. Support for comparative analysis across multiple samples/studies
4. Container support (Docker, Singularity) for improved portability

### Compatibility
- Future versions will maintain backward compatibility with output formats
- API for programmatic access to analysis functions may be added
