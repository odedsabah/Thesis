### Overview of the Databases
This study aimed to evaluate the consistency across various datasets that include both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we compiled publicly available metagenomic human microbiome datasets from 13 distinct cohorts, as detailed in Table 1. The datasets underwent rigorous cleaning and filtering, yielding a consolidated collection of 2243 samples.

Our dataset encompasses 995 samples from healthy controls (non-IBD), 669 samples from individuals with Crohn's Disease (CD), 556 from Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients, and 23 from cases of unclassified IBD. The demographic spread of the dataset includes participants from four countries, aged between 21 and 54 years. The median age in our study is 44 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 30 to 57 years.

Regarding gender distribution, our dataset comprises 1005 female and 874 male participants, as shown in Table 2. The figure "Description of Cohorts" provides a visual representation of these sample distributions.
